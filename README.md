# hello-world
I am new to GitHub, and this is my first project here.Such a pity I didn't start here sooner, but I am here now.  
Hello, my name is Lorson Blair. I am from Antigua and Barbuda, a twin Island nation in the Caribbean. I graduated from the Grambling State University in 2012 with a BS in Computer Science. I recently applied to attend graduate school to further my studies. 
I am simply adding some information about myself.
